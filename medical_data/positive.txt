Indication for admission, clinical diagnosis and management were collated. Results 3552 babies were admitted during the study period. Of these, 1651 were unexpected admissions and 208/1651 (12.6%) were as a result of positive pulse oximetry screening. 165/208 babies (79%) had a significant clinical condition which required further intervention including 17 with congenital heart defect (CHD) (nine critical), 55 with pneumonia, 30 with sepsis and 12 with pulmonary hypertension. No baby died or collapsed on the postnatal ward during the study period. 61/208 babies (29%) had echocardiography and CHD was detected in 28%. Conclusions Routine use of pulse oximetry screening identifies babies with CHD and other illnesses, which, if not identified early could potentially lead to postnatal collapse. It does not appear to overload clinical services, resulting in appropriate admission in the majority and a modest increase in the number of echocardiograms performed.

intake of folic acid, alcohol consumption and smoking. Pregnancy planning was assessed by the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP) and the five graded Swedish Pregnancy Planning Scale. RESULTS Most (77%) of the participants reported that their pregnancies were very or fairly well planned. Higher median LMUP scores were observed in women taking folic acid (p &lt; 0.001), in those consuming less alcohol, and in women who stopped smoking prior to pregnancy (p = 0.043). However, 43% of the respondents with a high degree of pregnancy planning and 98% of those with a low degree of planning had not taken folic acid prior to pregnancy. Binge drinking during early pregnancy was reported by 20% of women with a high degree of planned pregnancy and 31% of those with a low degree (p = 0.1). CONCLUSION Pregnancy planning was associated with a healthier lifestyle but still many women could improve their lifestyle in connection to pregnancy. Their level of alcohol consumption is higher than that recommended for best pregnancy outcome.

Stroke, death, and other surgical complications occurring within 30 days of surgery along with other case data. A low-volume surgeon performed 40 or fewer cases per year. Variables used in a comparison administrative database study, as well as variables identified by our univariate analysis, were used for adjusted analyses to assess for an association between low-volume surgeons and the rate of stroke and death as well as other complications. RESULTS The rate of stroke and death was 6.9% for low-volume surgeons and 2.0% for high-volume surgeons (P = .001). Complications were similarly higher (13.4% vs 7.2%, P = .008). Low-volume surgeons performed more nonelective cases. Low-volume surgeons were significantly associated with stroke and death in the unadjusted analysis as well as after adjustment with variables used in the administrative database study (odds ratio, 3.61; 95% CI, 1.70-7.67, and odds ratio, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.72-7.89, respectively). However, adjusting for the significant disparity of American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification in case mix eliminated the effect of surgeon volume on the rate of stroke and death (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 0.59-4.64) and other complications.

We randomly assigned 4 medical house staff teams (43 interns) using a 3-month crossover design to a 2003-compliant model of every fourth night overnight call (control) with 30-hour duty limits or to one of two 2011-compliant models of every fifth night overnight call (Q5) or a night float schedule (NF), both with 16-hour duty limits. We measured sleep duration using actigraphy and used admission volumes, educational opportunities, the number of handoffs, and satisfaction surveys to assess trainee education, continuity of patient care, and perceived quality of care. RESULTS The study included 560 control, 420 Q5, and 140 NF days that interns worked and 834 hospital admissions. Compared with controls, interns on NF slept longer during the on call period (mean, 5.1 vs 8.3 hours; P = .003), and interns on Q5 slept longer during the postcall period (mean, 7.5 vs 10.2 hours; P = .05). However, both the Q5 and NF models increased handoffs, decreased availability for teaching conferences, and reduced intern presence during daytime work hours. Residents and nurses in both experimental models perceived reduced quality of care, so much so with NF that it was terminated early.

Interrater reliability and criterion validity were determined for the measurement of these 3 tasks scored according to 5 methods: (1) in person (community standard), (2) slow motion review of the video recording (criterion standard), and (3-5) full speed review at 3 Internet bandwidths (64kps, 384kps, and 768kps).
We determined the sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operator characteristics curves (AUROCs), proportions correctly classified and the tendency to make performance seem better than it actually was.
GDP views and experiences.Results Of 130 respondents, 74.6% were aware of the scheme. There was greater awareness of the scheme among those with more years in practice (p = 0.003) and those who had trained in the UK (p = 0.002). Six GDPs reported using the YC scheme in the past four years (estimated overall use: 0.01 of a YC per GDP per year); 88.5% had never used the YC scheme. The main reason given was that they never saw ADRs (58.5%). GDPs who had received their undergraduate training in the UK were more likely to be aware of their responsibility to report ADRs as a dentist than those who had trained outside the UK (p = 0.009). While GDPs were able to identify a wide range of sources to help them learn about ADRs, over three quarters of respondents (76.9%) expressed a need for additional postgraduate training.

Among 175 male patients, ED was present in 70%; patients with ED had a higher incidence of multivessel CAD (80% vs. 36%, P 0.001), diffuse CAD (81% vs. 34%, P 0.001), and higher number of mean coronary vessels involved compared with those without ED. Those with severe ED had higher prevalence of multivessel CAD and higher number of mean coronary vessels involved compared with those with milder grades of ED. Onset of symptoms of ED preceded symptoms of CAD by a mean of 24.6 months in 84% of patients. The presence of severe ED was associated with a 21-fold higher risk of having triple-vessel disease (odds ratio [OR] 21.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.41-141.09, P=0.001) and an 18-fold higher risk of having diffuse angiographic CAD (OR 17.91, 95% CI 3.11-111.09, P=0.001).

Current activities of community pharmacists; pharmacists' opinions on PC practice and the barriers they might face in its implementation. Results For the questionnaire study the response rate was 83 % (205/246). Most dispensing activities were reported to be performed by a vast majority of respondents (94 % or more). A few PC activities were reported to be already performed by the majority of participants e.g. checking indications, interactions and contraindication (83 %, n = 171) and checking each repeat prescription for compliance (78 %, n = 159). However, the majority of PC activities were not performed. Nearly all pharmacist (99 %, n = 203) were willing to further implement PC practice, but reported a number of barriers to its implementation.

Postcombat PTSD symptoms. RESULTS Soldiers developed threat vigilance during combat deployment, particularly when they were exposed to high-intensity combat, as indicated by faster response times to targets appearing at the location of threat relative to neutral stimuli (P &lt; .001). Threat-related attention bias also interacted with combat exposure to predict risk for PTSD (P &lt; .05). Bias toward threat at recruitment (P &lt; .001) and bias away from threat just before deployment (P &lt; .05) predicted postcombat PTSD symptoms. Moreover, these threat-related attention associations with PTSD were moderated by genetic and environmental factors, including serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) genotype.
Psychiatric outcomes, which included depression, anxiety, antisocial personality disorder, substance use disorders, and suicidality (including recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or a suicide attempt), were assessed in young adulthood (19, 21, and 24-26 years) by use of structured diagnostic interviews. RESULTS Victims and bullies/victims had elevated rates of young adult psychiatric disorders, but also elevated rates of childhood psychiatric disorders and family hardships.

Autopsied subjects were classified into 5 categories: dementia with high-level Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathologic changes (NCs) but without Lewy body disease (LBD) NCs (AD group; n=244), dementia with LBDNCs and high-level ADNCs (LBD-AD group; n=224), dementia with LBDNCs and no or low levels of ADNCs (pure DLB [pDLB] group; n=91), Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) with no or low levels of ADNCs (n=81), and control group (n=269). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The APOE allele frequencies. RESULTS The APOE 4 allele frequency was significantly higher in the AD (38.1%), LBD-AD (40.6%), pDLB (31.9%), and PDD (19.1%) groups compared with the control group (7.2%; overall (2)(4)=185.25; P=5.56  10(-39)), and it was higher in the pDLB group than the PDD group (P= .01). In an age-adjusted and sex-adjusted dominant model, 4 was strongly associated with AD (odds ratio, 9.9; 95% CI, 6.4-15.3), LBD-AD (odds ratio, 12.6; 95% CI, 8.1-19.8), pDLB (odds ratio, 6.1; 95% CI, 3.5-10.5), and PDD (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7-5.6). CONCLUSIONS The APOE 4 allele is a strong risk factor across the LBD spectrum and occurs at an increased frequency in pDLB relative to PDD. This suggests that 4 increases the likelihood of presenting with dementia in the context of a pure synucleinopathy. The elevated 4 frequency in the pDLB and PDD groups, in which the overall brain neuritic plaque burden was low, indicates that apoE might contribute to neurodegeneration through mechanisms unrelated to amyloid processing.

A generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution and log link was used to examine the association between residential segregation and lung cancer mortality from 2003 to 2007 for black and white populations. Our primary independent variable was the racial index of dissimilarity. The index is a demographic measure that assesses the evenness with which whites and blacks are distributed across census tracts within each county. The score ranges from 0 to 100 in increasing degrees of residential segregation. RESULTS The overall lung cancer mortality rate was higher for blacks than whites (58.9% vs 52.4% per 100 000 population). Each additional level of segregation was associated with a 0.5% increase in lung cancer mortality for blacks (P &lt; .001) and an associated decrease in mortality for whites (P = .002). Adjusted lung cancer mortality rates among blacks were 52.4% and 62.9% per 100 000 population in counties with the least (&lt;40% segregation) and the highest levels of segregation (60% segregation), respectively. In contrast, the adjusted lung cancer mortality rates for whites decreased with increasing levels of segregation.

Reporting making routine yearly PDVs as a preventive measure. Education, material wealth index and nutritional status indicated socio-economic position. Multi-level logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the predictors of PDVs. A variant of Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis was also conducted. Health insurance coverage was most common among Whites (70%) and least common among black Africans (10.1%) in South Africa. Similarly, a yearly PDV was most frequently reported by Whites (27.8%) and least frequently reported among black Africans (3.1%). Lower education and lower material wealth were associated with lower odds of making PDVs. There was significant interaction between location (urban/rural) and education (p = 0.010). The racial and socio-economic differences in PDVs observed in urban areas were not observed in rural areas. In the general dentate population, having health insurance significantly increased the odds of making PDVs (OR = 4.32; 3.04-6.14) and accounted for 40.3% of the White/non-White gap in the probability of making PDVs. Overall, socio-economic position and health insurance enrollments together accounted for 55.9% (95% CI = 44.9-67.8) of the White/non-White gap in PDVs. Interventions directed at improving both socio-economic position and insurance coverage of non-White  South Africans are likely to significantly reduce racial disparities in PDVs.

Two assessors who were blinded to the methods of the intervention undertook the measurements.
Patients developing gingival hyperplasia during follow-up. A patient was classified as having gingival hyperplasia if symptoms were present and a dentist and/or a general practitioner had confirmed the diagnosis. For each case, potential controls were selected and matched on gender, age (year of birth), and index date (date of the diagnosis of gingival hyperplasia). Exposure (intake of CCBs or RAS) and other known risk factors for gingival hyperplasia (pregnancy, diabetes, and smoking), as well as cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, hypercholesterolemia, prior myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, dyslipidemia, and stroke) were assessed at the time of the index date, both for cases and for controls.

To allow a pooled estimate of prognosis from multiple studies, the estimated failure rate per year and estimated implant survival rate after 2 years was determined for each study. The estimated failure rate per study was determined as a function of number of implant failures and total implant "exposure" time. Exposure in this context means the time an implant is in vivo and, hence, exposed to failure risk. Consequently, exposure time includes implants followed the entire study, those up to the time of failure, and those followed to a premature study end (eg, patient death, moving, refusal to continue). When study data were not provided separately for the short implants in a publication, a proportional exposure (short implants/total implants  overall exposure time) was determined. The 2-year survival calculation made from the estimated failure rate assumed a constant rate of implant failure (considered to follow a Poisson distribution). Additional analyses sought to identify independent effects on failure based on implant surface topography (rough vs machined), maxilla versus mandible, smoking status, and augmentation.
The primary outcome measure in this study was survival of endosseous implants when used to support single crowns. In addition, the clinical performance of soft tissue (peri-implantitis) and hard tissue (bone level) was documented.

Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaire, Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional, Child Behaviour Checklist 1-5 and Mullen Scale of Early Learning. The intervention programme had no effect on cognitive, motor or behavioural development in this group of mainly moderate and late preterm infants at 36 months corrected age. Four explanations may be proposed: the programme has a less effect on moderate and late preterm infants than in more preterm infants; modifications of the intervention might increase efficacy; a cumulative effect of the intervention leads to more obvious effects at later ages, and an improved standard care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units may support infant development.

Secondary post hoc analysis outcomes included the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), length of stay in ICU and hospital, and survival. RESULTS Chloride administration decreased by 144 504 mmol (from 694 to 496 mmol/patient) from the control period to the intervention period. Comparing the control period with the intervention period, the mean serum creatinine level increase while in the ICU was 22.6 mol/L (95% CI, 17.5-27.7 mol/L) vs 14.8 mol/L (95% CI, 9.8-19.9 mol/L) (P = .03), the incidence of injury and failure class of RIFLE-defined AKI was 14% (95% CI, 11%-16%; n = 105) vs 8.4% (95% CI, 6.4%-10%; n = 65) (P &lt;.001), and the use of RRT was 10% (95% CI, 8.1%-12%; n = 78) vs 6.3% (95% CI, 4.6%-8.1%; n = 49) (P = .005). After adjustment for covariates, this association remained for incidence of injury and failure class of RIFLE-defined AKI (odds ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.37-0.75]; P &lt;.001) and use of RRT (odds ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.33-0.81]; P = .004). There were no differences in hospital mortality, hospital or ICU length of stay, or need for RRT after hospital discharge. CONCLUSION The implementation of a chloride-restrictive strategy in a tertiary ICU was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of AKI and use of RRT.

Temporal bones were serially sectioned in the horizontal plane and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The number of spiral ganglion cells, loss of cochlear hair cells, area of stria vascularis, and cell density of spiral ligament were evaluated using light microscopy.
Pure tone threshold changes detected by PTA and EFA, amplitude and reproducibility changes in transiently evoked OAE, distortion products, and tinnitus analysis based on a visual analog scale.
Change in air-bone gap (ABG) and pure tone average (PTA).
Worst and average pain and function were assessed at baseline, after the 2-week intervention, and at 6 and 12 weeks follow-up.
Incisional (superficial and deep) surgical site infection 30 days after the operation and risk factors for postoperative wound infections.
The results of each surveying method were compared. Participants provided feedback, via 18 interviews and 40 questionnaire surveys, about the benefits and disadvantages of a PJS compared to a CAS.
The patients' perceptions of support from physicians were measured with three items from the Cologne Patient Questionnaire. Physician support was studied in relation to patient characteristics as well as hospital structure and processes.
A two-step approach was used for analysis: the identification of at least one screening criterion (first endpoint) and the validation of each identified criterion (second endpoint), taking the assessment by medical residents as the reference. Kappa coefficient; simple percentage agreement; sensitivity; specificity; positive and negative predictive values were calculated.
Occurrence of type 2 diabetes based on multiple sources (mainly self-reports), verified against medical information.
Additional disabilities prevalence; medical history and radiologic abnormalities; and the effect on Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) score at 12 months postoperatively.
Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), muscle soreness, muscle pain intensity (electronic visual analog scale [VAS]), and maximal wrist extension force were assessed at time 0 (pre- and postexercise) and at time 1 (pre-, during, and post saline-induced pain).
Pain NRS (baseline, postprocedure, and hourly up to 6 hours) and GPI scale are expressed as percent improvement at 6 hours, relative to baseline.
Proportion of enteroviral meningitis without CSF pleocytosis.
